# TrivialCompute
Trivial Compute – a computer game for
teaching and learning
In this project, you will develop a computer game called Trivial Compute. The rules are exactly the same
as for the Hasbro game, Trivial Pursuit, with several simplifications. We recommend that you purchase
or borrow one of the box games, and spend some time playing it in order to become familiar with the
rules.
The main simplification is the shape of the board, the number of categories, and the shape of the tokens.
In Trivial Compute, the board is arranged in a square, with nine squares on each side. Spokes emanate
from a center square and meet the sides in “category headquarters” squares. The number of categories
has been reduced to four accordingly. The tokens that indicate the locations of the players are colored
dots. The score for each player is shown on the interior of the board as shown in the figure below.
The game can be played by one to four players. All players can be on the same computer. You should
use some sort of visual display to indicate the names of the players and who is the current player.
Before the game starts, the players will need to select the four categories of questions and assign the
colors. The names of the categories and assigned colors should then be displayed on the screen.
As the game is played, questions should be displayed in a window on the screen. The player will answer
the question orally. Then the players will push a button to reveal the correct answer. The opponents will
decide whether the player answered correctly or not. If correct, the player rolls again. If incorrect, the
player loses their turn and the next player takes their turn. For the center square, either the player or
the opponents will need to select the category of the question to be asked, so you will need a dialog for
this.
In this computerized version of the game, questions will be textual (as in Trivial Pursuit), or multimedia.
That is, you might show a picture and ask a question about it. Or you might play a sound recording or
video and ask about it.
Trivial Compute is intended to be a game for teaching and learning. We expect that this application will
be used by elementary and high school teachers as a way of quizzing their students. Thus, you will need
to provide a convenient way for teachers to create categories and questions. There should be a user’s
manual for teachers to guide them on the creation of the question-and-answer sets. The
category/question creator can be implemented as a separate application.
We expect this to be a three-tiered (GUI, server, database) application. It can be implemented as either
a stand-alone application, or as a web application. There are two GUI interfaces that must be
implemented: game play and category/question creation
